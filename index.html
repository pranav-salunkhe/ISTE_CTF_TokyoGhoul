        Ken Kaneki a High School Teenager who went on a date with a girl Rize Kamishiro. She turned out to be a ghoul and started consuming Kaneki. But something falls on her and she is knocked out. Kaneki escapes to the hospital where he is captured by Jason. Jason wants to use Kaneki for harvesting his organs. This is pretty dark if you ask me.
